        <p> Solána Imani Rowe (born November 8, 1989), known professionally as SZA (/ˈsɪzə/ SIZ-ə), is an American singer-songwriter. She first gained recognition through her self-released EPs See.SZA.Run (2012) and S (2013), which helped her become the first female artist to sign with Top Dawg Entertainment. Her third EP, Z (2014), was her first project to be released to digital retailers and reached the top-ten on the U.S. Independent Albums chart.<br><br>After signing a joint recording contract with RCA Records, SZA released her debut studio album, Ctrl (2017). It was met with critical and commercial success, earning four Grammy Award nominations and becoming the second longest-charting R&B album by a female artist on the Billboard 200.[1] The following year, SZA was nominated for the Golden Globe and Academy Awards for Best Original Song via her collaboration with Kendrick Lamar on the U.S. and UK top-ten single "All the Stars".[2] Her featured appearance on Doja Cat's "Kiss Me More" broke the record for the longest-running all-female collaboration within the U.S. top ten,[3] and won the Grammy Award for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance.</p>
    <p>SZA's second album, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOS_(SZA_album)"> SOS (SZA album)</a> (2022), spent ten non-consecutive weeks atop the Billboard 200 and broke the record for the largest streaming week for an R&B album in the U.S. Supported by six singles, including the top-ten songs "Good Days",[4] "I Hate U",[5] "Nobody Gets Me" and "Snooze", SZA earned her first number-one single on the Billboard Hot 100 with "Kill Bill" in 2023. She later earned her second chart-topping single of the year with her guest appearance on Drake's "Slime You Out".<br><br>
    SZA has received several accolades in her career, including four Grammy Awards, a Brit Award, an American Music Award, a Guild of Music Supervisors Award, and two Billboard Women in Music awards (including Woman of the Year).

    <h2> Early life and education </h2>
    <p>Solána Imani Rowe was born on November 8, 1989, in St. Louis. She grew up in Maplewood, New Jersey, often returning to St. Louis to visit her mother's family.[7][8][9][10] Her father was an executive producer at CNN, while her mother was an executive at AT&T. Rowe has an older half-sister, Panya Jamila.[8][11] Her mother is Christian and her father is Muslim.[11] She was raised as a Muslim and continues to follow Islam.[8] </p>
        <p>It's like the belief in one God, all the pillars of Islam et cetera, and I think those are ideas that will never leave me, those make sense in my spirit. It's the way that I connect with God; it has always made sense to me. I think I would love to wear my hijab but I feel like I don't wanna wear my hijab and talk crazy on stage and be in videos with Travis Scott. Like I don't wanna be disrespectful because I have too much love and respect for the religion, for my father, and for myself.[12]</p>
        <p>She attended a Muslim prep school every day after her regular schooling, where she used to wear hijab. After the September 11 attacks, Rowe was subjected to bullying in 7th grade, leading her to stop wearing one.[8][13] Rowe attended Columbia High School, where she was active in sports, including gymnastics and cheerleading.[14][12] After graduating from high school in 2008,[15] Rowe later went to three separate colleges, finally settling at Delaware State University to study marine biology.[8][11] She eventually dropped out in her last semester, taking on a variety of jobs in order to make money.[11][16][17]</p>
        <p>Rowe formed her stage name from the Supreme Alphabet, taking influence from rapper RZA of the Wu-Tang Clan. The last two letters in her name stand for Zig-Zag and Allah, while the first letter S can mean either savior or sovereign.[8]</p>

        <p>SZA first met members of Top Dawg Entertainment during the CMJ New Music Report in 2011, when her boyfriend's clothing company sponsored a show in which Kendrick Lamar was performing.

In another tweet, SZA indicated that "all [Punch] says to her" about releasing new music is "soon".[65] This revealed that her relationship with her label owner Punch (Top Dawg Entertainment) has been hostile since the delays of her second album which was last announced back in an interview in 2019.[66] SZA came back with her first release as a lead artist since 2017 on September 4, 2020, with "Hit Different", featuring Ty Dolla Sign, and production from The Neptunes.[66][67] On December 25, 2020, SZA released "Good Days" on streaming platforms as a single after it originally debuted as a snippet in the outro of the "Hit Different" music video.[68] English singer Jacob Collier provided background vocals for the single.[69] The song hit its peak of number 9 on the Billboard Hot 100,[70] making it SZA's first top-ten single as a solo artist, despite SZA herself revealing that it was not initially planned to be a single.[71] Both tracks were expected to appear on her then upcoming second studio album, with only "Good Days" eventually making the final cut.[72] </p>

        <p>On her 33rd birthday on November 8, 2022, SZA released a teaser titled "PSA" on her Instagram.

    <h2>Influences</h2>
        <div di = Influences > </div>
        <h3>Music</h3>
        <p>Growing up, SZA was exposed by her family to artists from different genres, which were formative influences for her music.[92] Her mother enjoyed R&B and church music,[93] her father was a fan of jazz and funk musicians like Miles Davis, Billie Holiday, and John Coltrane,[13][94] and her sister listened to melodic rap and hip hop artists like Tupac Shakur.[1][92] SZA listens to Ella Fitzgerald for vocal influence[95] and has said that Lauryn Hill is one of her personal influences.[96] SZA has expressed admiration for singer Ashanti, citing her as a major inspiration and someone she has loved since childhood.[97]</p>
        <p>SZA also cites Meelah, the Red Hot Chili Peppers, LFO, Macy Gray, Common, Björk, Jamiroquai, and "a lot of Wu, Nas, Mos Def, Hov" as inspirations.[8] Speaking on her influences, SZA said: "[My] personal influences came from dancing with American Ballet Theatre and doing pieces to Björk [music]. That's the only time I had really any outside influence to music. So, the people that I fell in love with on a musical level were always much older. Jamiroquai is just, like, the shit for me."[98] In an interview for Live Nation Entertainment, SZA described the meeting she had with Beyoncé for the writing of the song "Feeling Myself", affirming "Beyoncé might be the most perfect, beautiful being I've ever met in my whole life. She's the most inspirational woman on earth, next to my mother". SZA also spoke about Rihanna, admiring her strong and confident attitude, of someone who does only the music she wants to do, and that if there's anybody that she could imagine singing her words, it would be Rihanna.[99]</p>
        <p>SZA's songs are built over "layers of sliced, delayed, and reversed vocals" and contains "twists and mutates",[100][19] and her vocal style has been described as taking on the "lilt" of a jazz singer.[101] SZA is known as TDE's first woman signee and first singer, which also drew attention during the early stages of her career.[102] According to Marissa G. Muller of Rolling Stone magazine, SZA's vocals alternate between a "vapory husk and a sky-high falsetto".[103] Jordan Sargent of Pitchfork magazine labeled SZA's vocals as being "chillwave" and "ethereal".[104] SZA began writing songs due to being "passionate" about writing, and enjoyed poetry; when writing lyrics, SZA "freestyles" them in order to express whatever comes to her "mind", noting that it does not always make sense to herself.[16] Thematically, SZA's work contains "unravelling lyrics", that touch upon themes of sexuality, nostalgia, and abandonment.[100]</p> 
        <p>Critics have frequently described SZA as an R&B singer-songwriter,[105][106] a narrative for which she has expressed disdain[107] consistently since the beginning of her career.[108][109] The label felt disrespectful and lazy to her.[110] For her second studio album, SOS, she wanted to prove her versatility beyond R&B, disillusioned with how Black artists have been historically segregated from White artists through pigeonholing Black artists strictly within R&B music.[111][112] Other critics have written she combines R&B with rap[113][114] or pop music in her works,[115] and their attempts to pin her down to genres outside R&B has had SZA confused. She grew up listening to an eclectic combination of pop, rock, jazz, folk, and rap artists[112][116] and, as such, prefers to be labeled as someone who makes music and nothing more. She said: "when you try to label it, you remove the option for it to be limitless. It diminishes the music."[116] "Genre agnosticism" was how Michael Madden of Consequence described SZA's musical style.[117]</p>  
        <h3>Fashion</h3>
        <p>During an interview, SZA said she is less inspired by strictly music, and more inspired by creating art in general; she has looked up to people who were not "typical artists" including her "favorite gymnast, ice-skater, saxophonist, painter, or movie director", continuing to say she was particularly inspired by film director Spike Lee.[98] During an interview with W, SZA spoke on her style influences, saying a large amount of her style inspiration comes from movies, including Wes Anderson films, praising his use of "pantone color palette" and that she "would love to dress like a character from Moonrise Kingdom. Or perhaps Bill Murray in The Life Aquatic."[118] Along with her music, SZA's image has been compared to neo-soul artists Lauryn Hill and Erykah Badu.[102] SZA's hair became a point of interest during the early stages of her career and she discussed it in interviews with Vogue and Harper's Bazaar.[96] During her performances, SZA tends to wear "free-flowing" clothes that are easy to move around in and wears pajamas or baggy clothing onstage.[119]</p>
