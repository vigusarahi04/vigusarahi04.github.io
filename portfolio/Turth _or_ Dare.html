        <h3> Project Overview</h3>
        <p>The Truth or Dare App is an interactive platform designed to encourage users to disconnect from technology and reconnect with nature through playful truth-or-dare challenges. The app was developed using a user-centered design approach, incorporating tools like Figma for prototyping, as well as user flow diagrams, surveys, and personas to create a seamless and engaging user experience. The primary goal of the app is to inspire users to step away from screens and engage with the nature.</p>
