<p> Overview of project: The World Health Organization maintains an extensive global data catalog focusing on air emissions and their impact on public health. This includes information on the amount of particulate matter released into the air and the resulting mortality rates due to air pollution. Our team investigated how air quality correlates with the incidence of respiratory complications and deaths, exploring the connection between pollution levels and health outcomes.</p>
