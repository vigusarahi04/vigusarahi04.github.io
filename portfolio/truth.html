        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
            The Truth or Dare App is an interactive platform designed to encourage users to disconnect from technology 
            and reconnect with nature through playful truth-or-dare challenges. The app was developed using a user-centered 
            design approach, incorporating tools like Figma for prototyping, as well as user flow diagrams, surveys, and 
            personas to create a seamless and engaging user experience. The primary goal of the app is to inspire users 
            to step away from screens and engage with nature.
